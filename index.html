    <h1>I'm Glad You Clicked Me!</h1>
    <p>
      I glad you decided to click this button. In this section here, I decided to learn more about querySelector,
      addEventListener, and different functions to create a functional button that shows a modal. I wanted to know
      more about how things appear and disappear using the hidden function, as well as, see how websites utlize
      the escape key. I also coded using the DRY method, where I refactored my code as much as possible. I'm slowly
      learning to make creative and functional, user-friendly browers.
